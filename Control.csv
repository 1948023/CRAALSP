118;Defence capabilities;Maneuverability;Satellite evasive maneuver protocols are implemented;Satellite manoeuvre is an operational tactic that can be used by satellites fitted with chemical thrusters to avoid kinetic and some directed energy ASAT weapons. For unguided projectiles  a satellite can be commanded to move out of their trajectory to avoid impact. If the threat is a guided projectile  like most direct-ascent ASAT and co-orbital ASAT weapons  manoeuvre becomes more difficult and is only likely to be effective if the satellite can move beyond the view of the onboard sensors on the guided warhead.;SPARTA;Phase E;Space;Damage/Destruction of the satellite via the use of ASAT/Proximity operations, Damage/Destruction of segment assets;Mitigation Presence  Resilience Impact
119;Defence capabilities;Defensive Jamming and Spoofing;Jammes and spoofers are employed for defensive operations;A jammer or spoofer can interfere with sensors on an approaching kinetic ASAT weapon  impairing its ability to navigate accurately during the terminal phase of flight. When combined with maneuvering  this tactic enables a satellite to evade a kinetic attack effectively. Such systems could also deceive SDA sensors by manipulating the reflected radar signal  altering the perceived location  velocity  and quantity of detected satellites  resembling digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) jammers utilized in numerous military aircraft. Additionally  a space-based jammer might disrupt an adversary's communication capabilities.;SPARTA;Phase E;Space;Spoofing, Jamming;Mitigation Presence  
120;Defence capabilities;Deception and Decoys;Deception and decoys are employed for defensive capabilities;Deception tactics can be utilized to hide or mislead regarding a satellite's location  capability  operational status  mission type  and/or robustness. Public messaging  like launch announcements  might restrict information or actively spread misinformation about satellite capabilities  and operational techniques can obscure certain capabilities. Another tactic could involve altering satellite capabilities or payloads while in orbit. Satellites with interchangeable payload modules could deploy on-orbit servicing vehicles to periodically transfer payloads between satellites  complicating adversaries' targeting calculations by obscuring which payload is on which satellite. Additionally  satellites may employ tactical decoys to confuse ASAT weapon sensors and SDA systems. These decoys  such as inflatable devices mimicking satellite characteristics or electromagnetic decoys simulating RF signatures  are akin to aircraft using airborne decoys like the ADM-160 Miniature Air-launched Decoy (MALD).;SPARTA;Phase E;Space;Resource exhaustion, Malicious code/software/activity: Network exploit, Malicious code/software/activity: Software and vulnerabilities exploit, Malicious code/software/activity: Malicious injection, Electromagnetic interference, Damage/Destruction of the satellite via the use of ASAT/Proximity operations, Damage/Destruction of segment assets;Mitigation Presence  
121;Defence capabilities;Antenna Nulling and Adaptive Filtering;Antenna nulling and adaptive filtering are employed for defensive operations;Satellites can incorporate antennas designed to suppress signals from specific regions on the Earth's surface or areas in space where jamming is detected  a technique known as 'nulling'. While nulling can effectively counter jamming from identifiable locations  it may inadvertently block transmissions from friendly users within the nullified area. Conversely  adaptive filtering is employed to suppress particular frequency bands irrespective of their source. This method proves advantageous when jamming consistently occurs within certain frequency ranges  allowing satellite transmissions to proceed uninterrupted. However  the efficacy of adaptive filtering may diminish if a wideband jammer disrupts a significant portion of the utilized spectrum  potentially compromising overall system performance.;SPARTA;Phase E;Space;Malicious code/software/activity: Malicious injection, Jamming, Spoofing, Hijacking;Mitigation Presence  
122;Defence capabilities;Physical Seizure;Space traffic control and debris mitigation protocols are established;A spacecraft equipped for docking  manipulating  or maneuvering other satellites or debris can be deployed to prevent space-based attacks or alleviate their aftermath. This system could seize a threatening satellite used for hostile actions or rescue a disabled or hijacked satellite. It could also gather and eliminate harmful orbital debris generated by an attack. However  a key constraint is that each satellite's capability is limited by time and propellant  particularly depending on its orbit. For instance  a satellite stationed in GEO might not be well-suited to capture an object in LEO due to the substantial propellant required for repositioning. Therefore  physical seizure satellites might need to be stationed on Earth and dispatched to a specific orbit when required to counter a particular threat.;SPARTA;Phase E;Space;Seizure of Control, Damage/Destruction of the satellite via the use of ASAT/Proximity operations, Damage/Destruction of segment assets;Mitigation Presence

This tactic resembles the use of laser infrared countermeasures on aircraft to counter heat-seeking missiles. By disabling the guidance system of an ASAT weapon and potentially maneuvering to a different position  a satellite could evade a kinetic attack effectively. Additionally  such systems could hinder inspector satellites' ability to image a satellite seeking to conceal its capabilities or disrupt adversary space domain awareness efforts.;SPARTA;Phase E;Space;Damage/Destruction of the satellite via the use of ASAT/Proximity operations, Damage/Destruction of segment assets;Mitigation Presence
