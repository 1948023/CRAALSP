python _Main.py
```

This launches the graphical interface where you can:
- Select any of the four tools
- Monitor execution status
- View completion notifications

### Running Individual Tools

Each tool can also be run independently:

```bash
# BID Phase Assessment
python 0-BID.py

# Preliminary Risk Assessment
python 1-Risk_Assessment_0-A.py

# Complete Risk Assessment
python 2-Risk_Assessment.py

# Attack Graph Analyzer
python 3-attack_graph_analyzer.py
```

### Example Workflow

1. **Start with BID Phase** to assess initial project risk
2. **Use Risk Assessment 0-A** for preliminary threat analysis
3. **Run complete Risk Assessment** for detailed evaluation
4. **Analyze threat relationships** with Attack Graph Analyzer
5. **Generate comprehensive reports** from all tools

## üîß Configuration

### Attack Graph Analyzer Configuration

The attack graph analyzer can be configured by modifying variables in the script:

```python
# File selection (interactive or programmatic)
THREAT_FILE_NAME = "CSV_Export_[timestamp]/Threat_Analyzed.csv"

# Path analysis configuration
SPECIFIC_PATH_ANALYSIS = {
    "source_threat": "Social Engineering",
    "target_threat": "Seizure of control: Satellite bus",
    "max_path_length": 5
}

# Visualization settings
save_path = 0  # Save individual path plots
max_five = 0   # Limit to 5 combined paths
```

### Risk Assessment Configuration

Risk matrices and scoring criteria can be customized in each tool by modifying the relevant data structures in the source code.

## üìä Data Formats

### Threat Data Format (CSV)
```csv
THREAT;Likelihood;Impact;Risk
Social Engineering;High;Very High;Very High
Unauthorized physical access;Medium;Very High;High
Denial of Service;Low;Medium;Low
```

### Asset Data Format (JSON)
```json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Ground Station",
      "category": "Ground",
      "criticality": "High",
      "description": "Primary ground communication facility"
