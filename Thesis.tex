\begin{abstract}
Risk assessment is a fundamental component of space mission planning and operation, ensuring the identification, analysis, and mitigation of threats across all project phases. However, current risk assessment methodologies often lack standardization, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies, particularly when comparing risks across different projects. This thesis proposes a comprehensive framework for standardized risk assessment applicable to all phases of a space project, from the proposal phase to operational maintenance and end-of-life management.

The proposed framework establishes a structured methodology that allows for systematic risk identification, assessment and monitoring across multiple projects, reducing redundancy and improving comparability. Additionally, this research includes the development of an automated tool suite that simplifies risk evaluation processes, enabling efficient and repeatable assessments, facilitating objective risk comparisons between projects and supporting decision-making and resource allocation.

The developed Risk Assessment Tool Suite consists of four integrated components: a BID Phase assessment tool for initial project categorization, a preliminary risk assessment module for early-stage threat identification, a comprehensive risk evaluation system with detailed criteria analysis, and an attack graph analyzer for visualizing threat relationships in space systems. Each tool follows consistent methodological principles while addressing specific aspects of the risk assessment lifecycle.

Through this approach, the thesis aims to enhance risk governance in the space sector, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and traceability in risk management activities. The framework and toolset developed contribute to a more resilient and predictable project lifecycle, ultimately improving security during all phases of the mission and its cost-effectiveness. The tools have been validated through practical implementation and demonstrate significant improvements in assessment accuracy, time efficiency, and standardization compared to traditional manual approaches.

\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{ch:background}

\section{Space Systems Security Landscape}

Space systems present unique cybersecurity challenges that distinguish them from terrestrial information systems. The operating environment, communication constraints, and mission-critical nature of space assets create a complex threat landscape requiring specialized security approaches.

\subsection{Space System Architecture}

Modern space missions typically consist of four main segments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Space Segment}: Satellites, spacecraft, and orbital infrastructure
    \item \textbf{Ground Segment}: Ground stations, mission control centers, and data processing facilities
    \item \textbf{Link Segment}: Communication channels and data transmission pathways that interconnect all other segments, serving as the critical backbone for command, control, and data exchange between space and terrestrial assets
    \item \textbf{User Segment}: End-user terminals and applications consuming space-based services
\end{itemize}

Each segment presents distinct security challenges and threat vectors that must be considered in comprehensive risk assessment frameworks. The link segment is particularly critical as it represents the primary attack surface for adversaries seeking to intercept communications, inject malicious commands, or disrupt mission operations through communication interference. Since all mission-critical data and control signals must traverse these communication pathways, the link segment often becomes the most vulnerable point in the entire system architecture, requiring specialized security measures such as encryption, authentication protocols, and anti-jamming techniques.

\subsection{Threat Landscape}

The threat landscape for space systems encompasses both traditional cybersecurity threats and space-specific attack vectors, as extensively documented in CCSDS security recommendations and the ENISA Space Threat Landscape analysis. The unique operational environment of space systems creates vulnerability patterns that differ significantly from terrestrial IT infrastructure, requiring specialized threat modeling approaches.

\subsubsection{CCSDS-Identified Threat Categories}

The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has identified several critical threat categories that specifically target space mission components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Corruption}: Intentional or accidental modification of mission-critical data during transmission or storage
    \item \textbf{Physical/Logical Attacks}: Direct targeting of space assets through kinetic means or sophisticated cyber intrusion techniques
    \item \textbf{Interception/Eavesdropping}: Unauthorized monitoring of communication channels to extract sensitive mission data or operational intelligence
    \item \textbf{Jamming}: Deliberate interference with radio frequency communications to disrupt command and control operations
    \item \textbf{Denial-of-Service}: Overwhelming system resources to prevent legitimate access to critical space services
    \item \textbf{Masquerade/Spoofing}: Impersonation attacks targeting command authentication systems and ground station interfaces
    \item \textbf{Replay Attacks}: Retransmission of previously captured legitimate commands to trigger unauthorized spacecraft operations
    \item \textbf{Software Threats}: Malicious code injection, firmware manipulation, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities in space-qualified systems
    \item \textbf{Unauthorized Access/Hijacking}: Complete compromise of spacecraft control systems or ground segment infrastructure
    \item \textbf{Tainted Hardware Components}: Supply chain compromise involving malicious modifications to space-qualified hardware
    \item \textbf{Supply Chain Vulnerabilities}: Risks introduced through third-party vendors, contractors, and international partnerships
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ENISA Space Threat Assessment}

The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) Space Threat Landscape provides additional insights into emerging risks facing the European space sector. Key findings include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nefarious Activity/Abuse (NAA)}: Intended actions that target ICT systems, infrastructure and network by means of malicious acts with the aim to either steal, alter or destroy a specified target
    \item \textbf{Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking (EIH)}: Actions aiming to listen, interrupt or seize control of a third party communication without consent
    \item \textbf{Physical Attacks (PA)}: Actions which aim to destroy, exposure, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorised access to a physical asset such infrastructure, hardware or interconnection
    \item \textbf{Unintentional Damage (UD)}: Unintentional actions causing desctruction, harm or injury of property or persons and results in a failure or reduction in usefulness
    \item \textbf{Failures or malfunctions (FM)}: Partial or full insufficient functioning of an asset (hardware or software) 
    \item \textbf{Outages (OUT)}: Unexpected disruption of service or decrease in quality falling below a required level 
    \item \textbf{Disaster (DIS)}: A sudden accident or a natural catastrophe that causes great damage or loss of life
    \item \textbf{Legal (LEG)}: Legal actions of third parties (contracting or otherwise) in order to prohibit actions or compensate for loss based on applicable law
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Asset Landscape}

Understanding the comprehensive asset landscape is crucial for effective threat assessment in space systems. The Risk Assessment Tool Suite incorporates a detailed asset taxonomy derived from extensive analysis of space mission architectures, providing a foundation for systematic vulnerability identification and risk evaluation.

\paragraph{Ground Segment Assets}

The ground segment represents the terrestrial foundation of space operations, encompassing critical infrastructure that enables mission control, data processing, and user interface capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ground Stations}: Essential components for space-ground communications including tracking systems for spacecraft position monitoring, ranging equipment for distance measurement and orbital determination, transmission systems for uplink command delivery, and reception systems for downlink data acquisition
    \item \textbf{Mission Control Centers}: Centralized facilities managing telemetry processing for real-time spacecraft health monitoring, commanding systems for operational control, and analysis and support infrastructure for mission decision-making
    \item \textbf{Data Processing Centers}: Specialized facilities handling mission analysis for scientific and operational data interpretation, and payload processing systems for instrument data calibration and distribution
    \item \textbf{Remote Terminals}: Distributed access points providing network access for remote operations and software access for distributed mission management
    \item \textbf{User Ground Segment}: Supporting infrastructure including development systems for mission software and procedures, supportive infrastructure for mission planning and analysis, and operational systems for routine mission execution
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Space Segment Assets}

The space segment comprises the orbital components that execute mission objectives in the harsh environment of space:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform Subsystems}: Core spacecraft infrastructure including electrical power systems for energy generation and distribution, attitude control systems for spacecraft orientation and stability, communication systems for space-ground data links, command and data handling systems for onboard processing, telemetry systems for spacecraft health monitoring, and tracking systems for navigation and positioning
    \item \textbf{Payload Systems}: Mission-specific components including payload data handling systems for scientific or commercial data processing, payload communication modules for specialized data transmission, and untrusted data handling systems for processing external or unverified data sources
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Link Segment Assets}

The link segment provides the critical communication pathways that enable coordination and data exchange across the entire space system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inter-System Links}: Communication channels between platform and payload subsystems, enabling coordinated spacecraft operations
    \item \textbf{Intra-Segment Links}: Connections within ground segment components, between multiple space systems for constellation operations, and between ground wide area networks for distributed operations
    \item \textbf{Cross-Segment Links}: Critical pathways connecting space segment to ground segment for mission control, space segment to user segment for service delivery, and ground segment to user segment for data distribution
    \item \textbf{User-to-User Links}: Communication channels enabling inter-user connectivity and collaborative operations
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{User Segment Assets}

The user segment encompasses the end-user infrastructure that consumes and processes space-based services:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Communications}: Transmission systems for uplink communications to space systems and reception systems for downlink data acquisition
    \item \textbf{Processing Infrastructure}: Local processing capabilities for user-specific data analysis and application execution
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Asset Interdependencies and Vulnerabilities}

The comprehensive asset landscape reveals critical interdependencies that create potential vulnerability cascades:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Asset Categories and Associated Vulnerability Patterns}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Asset Category} & \textbf{Critical Components} & \textbf{Primary Vulnerability Areas} \\ \hline
Ground Segment & Ground stations, mission control & Physical security, network access, software integrity \\ \hline
Space Segment & Platform, payload systems & Environmental resilience, communication security, autonomous operation \\ \hline
Link Segment & Inter/intra/cross-segment links & Encryption, authentication, jamming resistance, protocol security \\ \hline
User Segment & User terminals, processing & Interface security, data handling, access control \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This comprehensive asset landscape provides the foundation for systematic threat modeling and risk assessment across all phases of space mission lifecycles. By understanding the complete inventory of critical assets and their interdependencies, security professionals can develop more effective threat scenarios and implement appropriate protective measures tailored to the specific characteristics of each asset category.

\vspace{13pt}
The evolving landscape requires continuous adaptation of security measures and risk assessment methodologies to address both current and emerging risks. This dynamic environment reinforces the importance of standardized, comprehensive risk assessment frameworks that can accommodate the unique challenges facing space systems across all mission phases.

\section{Existing Risk Assessment Frameworks}

\subsection{Traditional IT Risk Assessment}

Traditional IT risk assessment standards, such as ISO/IEC 27005 or NIST SP 800-30, are not fully adequate for conducting risk analysis in space programs due to the unique characteristics of the space domain. These standards are primarily designed for terrestrial IT environments and often fail to account for critical space-specific factors such as the harsh physical environment (radiation, temperature extremes, microgravity), the limited ability to perform physical maintenance or incident response in orbit, the high dependency on long-distance and delay-sensitive communication links, and the criticality of real-time operations. Moreover, the asset taxonomy, threat landscape, and impact evaluation criteria used in space missions differ significantly from conventional IT systems. As a result, applying traditional IT frameworks without significant adaptation may lead to underestimation of mission-critical risks or overlook threats unique to the space ecosystem.

\subsubsection{ISO/IEC 27005 Information Security Risk Management}

ISO/IEC 27005 provides a comprehensive approach to information security risk management but requires significant adaptation for space applications. The standard's strength lies in its systematic methodology for risk identification, analysis, and treatment. However, its terrestrial focus limits applicability to space systems in several key areas:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Asset Classification}: The standard's asset taxonomy does not adequately address space-specific components such as spacecraft subsystems, orbital mechanics considerations, or ground-space communication links
    \item \textbf{Threat Environment}: Limited consideration of space-specific threats such as radiation-induced errors, orbital debris impacts, or space weather effects
    \item \textbf{Vulnerability Assessment}: Insufficient attention to unique space system vulnerabilities including long communication delays, limited bandwidth, and inability to perform physical maintenance
    \item \textbf{Impact Analysis}: Terrestrial impact categories do not fully capture the consequences of space mission failures, including cascading effects on dependent services and scientific objectives
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{NIST SP 800-30 Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments}

The NIST Risk Management Framework provides structured methodologies for conducting risk assessments within the broader context of organizational risk management. While comprehensive in scope, several limitations emerge when applied to space systems:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{NIST SP 800-30 Adaptation Challenges for Space Systems}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Framework Component} & \textbf{Standard Approach} & \textbf{Space Domain Challenges} \\ \hline
Risk Assessment Process & Sequential, iterative analysis & Requires parallel assessment across segments \\ \hline
Threat Source Identification & IT-centric threat actors & Must include space-specific threats \\ \hline
Vulnerability Assessment & Software/network focus & Hardware, environmental vulnerabilities \\ \hline
Likelihood Determination & Historical data emphasis & Limited space incident data \\ \hline
Impact Analysis & Confidentiality, integrity, availability & Mission success, safety considerations \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Space-Specific Standards}

Industry standards such as CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) security recommendations and ECSS (European Cooperation for Space Standardization) provide space-specific guidance that addresses the unique technical, operational, and environmental characteristics of space missions. These standards are crucial for defining consistent practices in areas such as data handling, ground-space communication protocols, system reliability, and interface specifications. However, while they offer important security and system design recommendations tailored to space systems, they often lack detailed and systematic methodologies for performing comprehensive cyber and physical risk assessments. In particular, they do not always include structured threat modeling techniques, quantitative risk metrics, or formalized impact-probability matrices adapted to the dynamic and interdependent nature of space assets. Consequently, organizations implementing these standards must often integrate additional frameworks or develop custom risk assessment processes to evaluate vulnerabilities, threats, and mitigation strategies effectively across all mission phases. This gap highlights the need for harmonizing space-domain expertise with advanced risk assessment methodologies to ensure robust protection of both space and ground segments.

\subsubsection{CCSDS Security Framework}

The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has developed several security-related recommendations that provide foundational guidance for space mission security:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CCSDS 350.0-G-3}: Space Communications Security Guidelines, which establish baseline security requirements for space-ground communications
    \item \textbf{CCSDS 351.0-B-2}: Space Data Systems Security Specification, defining cryptographic algorithms and protocols for space applications
    \item \textbf{CCSDS 352.0-B-2}: Space Communications Cross Support Security Specification, addressing multi-agency cooperation scenarios
\end{itemize}

While these standards provide essential technical specifications, they primarily focus on communication security rather than comprehensive risk assessment methodologies.

\subsubsection{ECSS Standards for Space Systems}

The European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) provides a comprehensive framework for space system development, including security considerations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ECSS-Q-ST-80}: Software Product Assurance, addressing software security throughout the development lifecycle
    \item \textbf{ECSS-E-ST-40}: Software Engineering, including security requirements and verification approaches
    \item \textbf{ECSS-M-ST-10}: Space Project Management, incorporating security considerations into project planning
\end{itemize}

These standards provide systematic approaches to space system development but require supplementation with dedicated risk assessment methodologies.

\section{Related Work}

Recent research in space cybersecurity has addressed various aspects of the security challenge, but few comprehensive frameworks exist for standardized risk assessment across project lifecycles. The academic and industrial communities have made significant contributions to understanding space system vulnerabilities and developing targeted security solutions, yet gaps remain in systematic risk assessment methodologies.

\subsection{Academic Research Contributions}

\subsubsection{Space System Vulnerability Analysis}

    \item \textbf{Physical Layer Attacks}: Investigation of RF jamming, spoofing, and interception techniques targeting space communication links
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Threat Modeling Methodologies}

Several researchers have developed specialized threat modeling approaches for space systems:

    \item \textbf{Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC)}: Collaboration on space debris mitigation with security implications
    \item \textbf{European Space Agency Security Office}: Development of European-wide space security policies and standards
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Gaps and Limitations}

Despite significant progress, several critical gaps remain in space cybersecurity research:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Current Research Gaps in Space Cybersecurity}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Research Area} & \textbf{Current State} & \textbf{Identified Gaps} \\ \hline
Standardized Methodologies & Limited frameworks & Lack of lifecycle-integrated approaches \\ \hline
Quantitative Metrics & Early development & Insufficient validation and benchmarking \\ \hline
Tool Integration & Individual solutions & Lack of integrated assessment platforms \\ \hline
Cross-Domain Analysis & Isolated assessments & Limited multi-domain risk correlation \\ \hline
Validation Studies & Theoretical models & Insufficient real-world validation \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The identified gaps in existing research and industry practices highlight the need for comprehensive, standardized risk assessment frameworks that can address the full lifecycle of space projects while providing practical, implementable solutions for industry adoption.

% ============================================================================
% CHAPTER 3: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
% ============================================================================
\chapter{Theoretical Framework}
\label{ch:framework}

This chapter presents the theoretical foundation of the standardized risk assessment framework developed in this research. The framework is designed to address the unique challenges and requirements associated with space systems, while simultaneously ensuring methodological consistency, repeatability, and adaptability across the entire lifecycle of space projects. By combining domain-specific considerations with a structured and scalable approach, the proposed framework aims to bridge the gap between traditional IT-centric risk models and the operational realities of the space sector.

\section{Framework Principles}

The proposed framework is built upon a set of core principles that ensure its applicability, flexibility, and robustness in the context of space missions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lifecycle Integration}: Risk assessment methodologies that span from project conception to end-of-life
    \item \textbf{Standardization}: Consistent approaches enabling cross-project comparison and learning
    \item \textbf{Automation}: Tool-supported processes reducing manual effort and improving consistency
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Methodologies applicable to projects of varying size and complexity
    \item \textbf{Traceability}: Clear documentation and reasoning for all risk decisions
\end{itemize}

\section{Risk Assessment Phases}

The framework identifies four distinct phases requiring specialized risk assessment approaches:
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{image.png}
    \caption{The Steps and Cycles in the risk management process}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{BID Phase Assessment}
The BID Phase Assessment represents the earliest opportunity to integrate cybersecurity considerations into a space project. Conducted during the proposal or pre-feasibility stage, this initial evaluation aims to align the project’s scope, budget, and planning assumptions with a realistic understanding of risk exposure. The assessment is based primarily on the project category (e.g., scientific mission, commercial payload, defense satellite) and its high-level functional and operational requirements. Although limited in technical detail at this stage, the process focuses on identifying fundamental cybersecurity constraints and potential mission-critical vulnerabilities that could affect project viability. This includes considerations such as mission criticality, reliance on third-party infrastructure (e.g., commercial ground stations), initial compliance with applicable standards (e.g., ECSS or ISO/IEC), and the presence of potential regulatory or geopolitical risks. The output of this phase informs the allocation of security resources, the initial definition of risk tolerance, and the inclusion of security planning in project proposals and contractual frameworks.

\subsection{Preliminary Risk Assessment}
The Preliminary Risk Assessment is conducted in the early stages of system design and requirement definition, typically during Phase 0/A of the mission lifecycle. Its objective is to create a structured foundation for subsequent security engineering and risk management activities. This phase involves the identification and categorization of key mission assets—such as onboard subsystems, data links, ground segment interfaces, and mission-critical software components. This phase promotes early visibility into systemic vulnerabilities, allowing for the definition of security requirements that can be integrated into system architecture, redundancy strategies, and operational planning. The outputs include a threat-asset matrix, initial risk register, and a prioritized list of areas requiring further analysis or mitigation in the next phase.

\subsection{Comprehensive Risk Assessment}
The Comprehensive Risk Assessment represents the most detailed and analytically intensive phase of the framework. Typically carried out during system development, integration, and testing phases (Phase B/C/D), it leverages a standardized taxonomy of threat types (e.g., nefarious activity, eavesdropping, physical sabotage), asset categories (e.g., space, ground, link, user), and lifecycle phases. The analysis employs both qualitative and quantitative methods, including risk scoring based on likelihood-impact matrices and attack path modeling. This phase also evaluates control effectiveness, environmental constraints, access complexity, and response capabilities. Special attention is paid to interdependencies among system components and cascading failure scenarios. The result is a comprehensive risk profile that supports informed decisions on design trade-offs, security control implementation, and mission assurance planning. Additionally, the assessment facilitates cross-domain alignment, particularly when projects involve international partners or dual-use technologies.

\subsection{Operational Risk Monitoring}
Operational Risk Monitoring begins at the launch phase and continues throughout in-orbit operations until the end of the system's active lifecycle. This phase shifts focus from design-time analysis to runtime threat detection and adaptive response. It incorporates continuous monitoring mechanisms, anomaly detection tools, telemetry analysis, and security event logging to assess real-time system health and potential security breaches. A distinguishing feature of this phase is the use of threat relationship analysis and attack path identification, which model how individual vulnerabilities or threat events could be linked across different system layers or mission phases to create multi-step attacks (e.g., ground-to-space intrusion vectors). This intelligence-driven approach enhances situational awareness and supports the formulation of dynamic countermeasures or contingency protocols. Operational risk monitoring also involves the periodic reevaluation of previously identified risks in light of new threat intelligence, system updates, or changes in mission configuration. The outputs are updated risk registers, incident response strategies, and data supporting long-term resilience assessments.

\section{Methodological Approach}

Each phase of the proposed risk assessment framework adopts tailored methodologies that address the unique needs and information availability of that particular stage in the project lifecycle. Despite the diversity of techniques employed, from high-level qualitative assessments during early conceptual phases to detailed quantitative modeling in later stages, methodological consistency is ensured through the use of shared principles, structured processes, and unified data representations.

At the core of this approach lies a standardized risk data model, which includes a common taxonomy of threats, asset classifications, evaluation criteria, and scoring metrics. This shared data structure facilitates the smooth transition of risk-related knowledge across lifecycle phases, reducing information loss and improving traceability. For example, threats identified during the Preliminary Risk Assessment are refined and expanded upon in the Comprehensive Risk Assessment using the same underlying classification system, enabling seamless aggregation, comparison, and revision of risk data over time.

Crucially, the framework is designed to be compatible with tool-supported implementation, facilitating partial automation of processes such as asset mapping, vulnerability identification, risk scoring, and documentation generation. This modular and data-centric approach ensures that each methodological component contributes coherently to an integrated and evolving risk profile throughout the entire mission lifecycle.

\section{Space Systems Risk Taxonomy}
The framework implements a dual-phase risk assessment methodology specifically designed for space systems cybersecurity. This approach combines preliminary rapid assessment capabilities with comprehensive detailed analysis, utilizing criteria-based evaluation and quadratic mean computation for robust risk quantification.

\subsection{Preliminary Risk Assessment}

The preliminary risk assessment provides rapid risk evaluation capabilities for initial threat identification and priority setting during early mission phases. This methodology focuses on threat-centric analysis with streamlined assessment criteria.

\subsubsection{Threat-Centric Assessment Approach}

The preliminary assessment employs a threat-centric methodology where each identified threat is evaluated against all relevant assets using seven specialized criteria. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining assessment efficiency:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vulnerability Effectiveness}: Evaluates how effectively known vulnerabilities can be exploited in the current system state, ranging from resolved vulnerabilities to actively exploitable weaknesses
    \item \textbf{Mitigation Presence}: Assesses the presence and effectiveness of security countermeasures, from multi-level validated defenses to complete absence of relevant protections
    \item \textbf{Detection Probability}: Measures the likelihood that malicious activities will be detected, spanning real-time automated detection to complete absence of detection capabilities
    \item \textbf{Access Complexity}: Evaluates the difficulty for attackers to gain system access, from strongly protected environments to completely open access points
    \item \textbf{Privilege Requirement}: Assesses the level of system privileges needed for successful exploitation, from root access requirements to no authentication needs
    \item \textbf{Response Delay}: Measures organizational response capabilities, from predefined automated responses to complete absence of response procedures
    \item \textbf{Resilience Impact}: Evaluates operational impact on system resilience, from no disruption with automatic failover to irreversible asset loss
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Likelihood and Impact Computation}

The preliminary methodology employs a structured approach to derive likelihood and impact values from the seven assessment criteria:

\textbf{Likelihood Calculation}: The first five criteria (Vulnerability Effectiveness through Privilege Requirement) contribute to likelihood assessment. Each criterion is scored on a 1-5 scale, and the overall likelihood is computed using quadratic mean to emphasize higher risk factors
\textbf{Impact Assessment}: The last two criteria (Response Delay and Resilience impact) contribute to the impact score, offering focused evaluation of operational consequences and business continuity implications

$$L = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i^2}$$

where $C_i$ represents the score for criterion $i$.


\textbf{Risk Level Determination}: Final risk levels are determined using the ISO 27005 risk matrix, combining computed likelihood and impact values to produce standardized risk classifications (Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High).

\subsection{Comprehensive Risk Assessment}

The comprehensive risk assessment provides detailed asset-focused analysis for thorough risk evaluation during detailed design and implementation phases. This methodology emphasizes asset vulnerabilities and multi-dimensional impact analysis.

\subsubsection{Asset-Centric Assessment Framework}

The comprehensive assessment employs an asset-centric approach where each asset is evaluated using nine specialized criteria covering both likelihood and impact dimensions. This methodology provides holistic risk understanding across technical and business domains:

\textbf{Likelihood Factors}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dependency}: Evaluates asset criticality to mission operations, from non-critical support functions to essential mission-critical components
    \item \textbf{Penetration}: Assesses potential system access levels, from isolated user access to full privileged control of core infrastructure
    \item \textbf{Cyber Maturity}: Evaluates organizational cybersecurity governance, from mature audited systems to minimal cybersecurity procedures
    \item \textbf{Trust}: Assesses stakeholder trustworthiness, from strategic partners under strict control to unknown entities with unclear intent
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact Factors}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance}: Measures operational performance impact, from minimal effects to unacceptable degradation with no alternatives
    \item \textbf{Schedule}: Evaluates project timeline impact, from minimal delays to inability to achieve major milestones
    \item \textbf{Costs}: Assesses financial implications, from minimal cost increases to substantial budgetary impacts exceeding 15\%
    \item \textbf{Reputation}: Evaluates reputational consequences, from contained internal issues to irreparable international damage
    \item \textbf{Recovery}: Measures recovery time requirements, from limited damage with quick restoration to catastrophic long-term mission loss
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Multi-Dimensional Risk Calculation}

The comprehensive methodology employs sophisticated risk computation that integrates multiple assessment dimensions:

\textbf{Likelihood Computation}: The four likelihood criteria are combined using quadratic mean calculation to emphasize critical vulnerabilities:

\textbf{Impact Computation}: The five impact criteria are similarly combined using quadratic mean to capture the most severe potential consequences:

$$I_{comp} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k^2}$$

where $I_k$ represents the criterion scores.

\textbf{Integrated Risk Assessment}: The final risk level combines computed likelihood and impact using the same ISO 27005 risk matrix, ensuring consistency across assessment methodologies while providing enhanced granularity through multi-factor analysis.

\subsubsection{Quadratic Mean Rationale}

The framework employs quadratic mean (root mean square) rather than arithmetic mean for criterion aggregation based on risk assessment best practices:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Emphasis on High-Risk Factors}: Quadratic mean assigns greater weight to higher individual scores, ensuring that critical vulnerabilities or severe impacts are not diluted by lower-scoring criteria
    \item \textbf{Mathematical Robustness}: The quadratic approach provides more stable and discriminating results compared to simple averaging, particularly important for security assessments where extreme values indicate critical risks
    \item \textbf{Conservative Risk Posture}: This approach supports conservative risk management by ensuring that high-severity individual factors drive overall risk assessments
    \item \textbf{Industry Alignment}: Quadratic mean aligns with established practices in safety-critical industries where maximum credible consequences drive risk evaluation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assessment Integration and Validation}

Both preliminary and comprehensive methodologies support assessment integration and validation through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cross-Methodology Validation}: Results from preliminary threat-centric and comprehensive asset-centric assessments can be compared to identify discrepancies and ensure assessment consistency
    \item \textbf{Iterative Refinement}: Assessment results can be refined through multiple evaluation cycles as mission details and threat intelligence evolve
    \item \textbf{Expert Review Integration}: Structured mechanisms for incorporating expert judgment and domain knowledge into quantitative assessments
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Management}: Recognition and documentation of assessment uncertainties and confidence levels to support informed decision-making

\end{itemize}

\section{Risk Treatment Strategies}

\subsection{Risk Calculation Engine}

The risk calculation follows a multi-dimensional approach based on ISO 27005 methodology, implementing a two-stage process for accurate risk quantification:

\subsubsection{Stage 1: Likelihood and Impact Calculation}

The framework calculates likelihood and impact using quadratic mean (Root Mean Square) to properly weight extreme values:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Likelihood and Impact Calculation]
def calculate_likelihood_impact(vulnerability, access_control, defense_capability):
    """
    Calculate likelihood using quadratic mean of relevant criteria
    """
    likelihood_factors = [vulnerability, access_control, defense_capability]
    
    # Quadratic mean calculation (RMS)
    likelihood = math.sqrt(sum(x**2 for x in likelihood_factors) / len(likelihood_factors))
    
    return likelihood

def calculate_impact(operational_impact, recovery_time):
    """
    Calculate impact using quadratic mean of consequence criteria
    """
    impact_factors = [operational_impact, recovery_time]
    
    # Quadratic mean calculation (RMS)
    impact = math.sqrt(sum(x**2 for x in impact_factors) / len(impact_factors))
    
    return impact
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Stage 2: ISO 27005 Risk Matrix Application}

After calculating likelihood and impact values, the framework applies the ISO 27005 risk assessment matrix to determine the final risk level:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{ISO 27005 Risk Matrix}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Likelihood}} & \multicolumn{5}{c|}{\textbf{Impact}} \\ \cline{2-6}
& \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} & \textbf{5} \\ \hline
\textbf{5} & Medium & High & High & Very High & Very High \\ \hline
\textbf{4} & Medium & Medium & High & High & Very High \\ \hline
\textbf{3} & Low & Medium & Medium & High & High \\ \hline
\textbf{2} & Low & Low & Medium & Medium & High \\ \hline
\textbf{1} & Very Low & Low & Low & Medium & Medium \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Complete Risk Calculation Implementation]
import math

def calculate_comprehensive_risk(vulnerability, access_control, defense_capability, 
                               operational_impact, recovery_time):
    """
    Complete risk calculation using quadratic mean and ISO 27005 matrix
    """
    # Stage 1: Calculate likelihood and impact using quadratic mean
    likelihood_raw = calculate_likelihood_impact(vulnerability, access_control, defense_capability)
    impact_raw = calculate_impact(operational_impact, recovery_time)
    
    # Normalize to 1-5 scale
    likelihood = min(5, max(1, round(likelihood_raw)))
    impact = min(5, max(1, round(impact_raw)))
    
    # Stage 2: Apply ISO 27005 risk matrix
    risk_matrix = {
        (1,1): "Very Low", (1,2): "Low", (1,3): "Low", (1,4): "Medium", (1,5): "Medium",
        (2,1): "Low", (2,2): "Low", (2,3): "Medium", (2,4): "Medium", (2,5): "High",

    risk_mapping = {
        "Very Low": 1,
        "Low": 2,
        "Medium": 3,

        ['Very Low', 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'],
        default='Very High'
    )
    
    return risk_scores, risk_levels
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Technical Challenges and Solutions}

\subsection{Asset Data Management Enhancement}

\subsubsection{Centralized Asset Data Loading}

The tools were enhanced to implement centralized asset data management through CSV-based loading:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Enhanced Asset Loading Implementation]
def load_asset_categories_from_csv(self):
    """Load asset categories from Asset.csv with error handling"""
    assets_file = os.path.join(get_base_path(), "Asset.csv")
    asset_categories = []
    seen_combinations = set()
    
    try:
        with open(assets_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, delimiter=';')
            for row in reader:
                category = row.get('categories', '').strip()
                subcategory = row.get('subCategories', '').strip()
                
                combination = (category, subcategory)
                if combination not in seen_combinations and category and subcategory:
                    seen_combinations.add(combination)
                    asset_categories.append(combination)
        
        return asset_categories
        
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Graceful fallback to hardcoded assets
        return self.get_default_asset_categories()
    except Exception as e:
        self.log_error(f"Error loading assets: {e}")
        return self.get_default_asset_categories()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Data Consistency and Validation}

The implementation includes robust data validation and consistency checking:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Delimiter Handling}: Proper CSV parsing with semicolon delimiters
    \item \textbf{Duplicate Prevention}: Automatic removal of duplicate asset combinations
    \item \textbf{Error Recovery}: Graceful fallback to default assets when CSV loading fails
    \item \textbf{Data Integrity}: Validation of required fields and data completeness
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PyInstaller Configuration and Deployment}

\subsubsection{Executable Packaging Optimization}

The tool suite required careful configuration of PyInstaller settings to ensure proper inclusion of data files and dependencies:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Enhanced PyInstaller Configuration]
# Enhanced .spec file configuration
a = Analysis(
    ['Risk_Assessment_Tool.py'],
    pathex=[],
    binaries=[],
    datas=[
        ('Asset.csv', '.'),           # Include asset data
        ('logo.ico', '.'),            # Application icon
        ('export_import_functions.py', '.'),  # Shared utilities
        ('attack_graph_threat_relations.csv', '.')  # Threat data
    ],
    hiddenimports=['tkinter', 'tkinter.ttk', 'PIL.Image', 'PIL.ImageTk'],
    hookspath=[],
    runtime_hooks=[],
    excludes=['matplotlib', 'numpy.testing'],  # Reduce size
    noarchive=False,
    optimize=2,
)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Console Window Management}

Proper configuration of console visibility was implemented to ensure appropriate user experience:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GUI Applications}: Console disabled (`console=False`) for user-facing tools
    \item \textbf{Debug Mode}: Console enabled for development and troubleshooting
    \item \textbf{Logo Integration}: Enhanced icon handling with format validation
    \item \textbf{Path Resolution}: Robust path handling for both development and executable environments
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Error Handling and Robustness}

\subsubsection{Comprehensive Error Management}

A robust error handling framework was implemented to ensure operational reliability:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Enhanced Error Handling Framework]
class ErrorHandler:
    """Centralized error handling with graceful degradation"""
    
    def handle_color_reference_error(self, color_key, fallback='#CCCCCC'):
        """Handle missing color references gracefully"""
        try:
            return COLORS[color_key]
        except KeyError:
            self.log_warning(f"Color '{color_key}' not found, using fallback")
            return fallback
    
    def handle_file_operation_error(self, operation, filepath, exception):
        """Handle file operation errors with user feedback"""
        error_message = f"File operation '{operation}' failed for {filepath}: {exception}"
        self.log_error(error_message)
        self.show_user_notification(error_message, severity='error')
        return None
    
    def ensure_graceful_degradation(self, primary_function, fallback_function):
        """Implement graceful degradation for critical functions"""
        try:
            return primary_function()
        except Exception as e:
            self.log_error(f"Primary function failed: {e}")
            return fallback_function()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{User Experience Continuity}

The error handling system prioritizes user experience continuity:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graceful Fallbacks}: Automatic fallback to safe alternatives when errors occur
    \item \textbf{User Notification}: Clear, non-technical error messages for end users
    \item \textbf{Operation Continuity}: Tools remain functional even when non-critical components fail
    \item \textbf{Recovery Procedures}: Automated recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Asset Data Centralization and Management}

\subsubsection{Transition from Static to Dynamic Asset Loading}

A significant enhancement implemented during development was the transition from static asset definitions to dynamic CSV-based asset loading. This improvement addressed several critical limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maintainability}: Centralized asset data eliminates code duplication across tools
    \item \textbf{Flexibility}: Easy addition or modification of asset categories without code changes
    \item \textbf{Consistency}: Unified asset taxonomy across all assessment phases
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Support for larger and more complex asset hierarchies
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Asset.csv Structure and Implementation}

The centralized asset database follows a structured format designed for comprehensive coverage of space system components:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Asset.csv Structure and Content Distribution}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Subcategories} & \textbf{Asset Count} \\ \hline
Ground & Ground Stations, Mission Control, Data Processing & 12 \\ \hline
Space & Platform, Payload & 8 \\ \hline
Link & Communication Links & 6 \\ \hline
User & User Segments & 8 \\ \hline
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{9 Unique Combinations} & \textbf{34 Assets} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The implementation ensures robust data loading with comprehensive error handling:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Robust Asset Loading with Validation]
def load_assets_from_csv(self):
    """Enhanced asset loading with comprehensive validation"""
    assets_file = os.path.join(get_base_path(), "Asset.csv")
    
    try:
        with open(assets_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, delimiter=';')
            
            # Validate CSV structure
            required_fields = ['categories', 'subCategories', 'asset']

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Robust Path Resolution Implementation]
def get_base_path():
    """Enhanced path resolution for multiple execution contexts"""
    if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):
        # Running as compiled executable
        if hasattr(sys, '_MEIPASS'):
            # PyInstaller temporary folder
            base_path = sys._MEIPASS
        else:
            # Standard executable directory
            base_path = os.path.dirname(sys.executable)
    else:
        # Running as Python script
        base_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    
    # Validate path exists and log for debugging
    if not os.path.exists(base_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Base path not found: {base_path}")
    
    return base_path
\end{lstlisting}
